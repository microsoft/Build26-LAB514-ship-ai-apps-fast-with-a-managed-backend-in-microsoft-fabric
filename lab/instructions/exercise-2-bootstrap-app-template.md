# Exercise 2: Bootstrap App from Template

In this exercise, you'll create a new Rayfin project from the **Field Services** template.

The template handles the setup for you, so you can focus on the lab.
> [!Tip]
> In this lab environment, the template is available locally at `C:\LabFiles\template\field-services-app`. The `rayfin` CLI knows how to find it by name.

## Task 1: Bootstrap a new Rayfin project from the Field Services template

1. Open a terminal in Visual Studio Code by selecting **View** > **Terminal** from the toolbar.

1. Type/Add the following command into the terminal, but do not press **Enter** yet. Leave `<workspace-uri>` in place for now.

    ```shell
    npm create @microsoft/rayfin@latest -- --project-name field-services-app --template "C:/LabFiles/template/field-services-app" --workspace-uri <workspace-uri>
    ```

1. Navigate back to your browser where you have the Microsoft Fabric portal open.

1. In the left-hand navigation pane, select **Workspaces** and then select the `Lab514-workorders-@lab.LabInstance.Id` workspace you created in Task 5 of the previous exercise.

1. Once the workspace loads, copy the URL from the browser address bar. Remove anything after the workspace ID. The URL should look like `https://app.fabric.microsoft.com/groups/<workspace-id>`.

1. Return to the terminal. In the command you pasted, replace `<workspace-uri>` with the Fabric workspace URL you just copied, then press **Enter** to bootstrap a new Rayfin project from the Field Services template.

1. When prompted, type `y` and press **Enter** to approve the installation of the npm packages. The CLI will then:
    - Create a new folder called `field-services-app` in your current directory.
    - Copy the template files into a new `field-services-app` folder.
    - Wire the project to your Fabric workspace using the `--workspace-uri` you provided.
    - Run `npm install` in the new project folder to pull dependencies (this can take a couple of minutes on first run).

1. As this is running, open the `/data` folder at *C:\LabFiles\template\field-services-app* to see the original prompt and dataset used to generate this template. This will give you a better understanding of how the app was built and ideas on how to customize it later in the lab.

## Task 2: Explore the generated project and make your first commit

In this task, you will inspect the generated project, initialize a Git repository, and make your first commit. This is important for GitHub Copilot CLI in later exercises, as it will show you clean diffs and what it will be changing when you ask it to generate code.

1. In the Visual Studio Code Explorer, expand the `field-services-app` folder that was created by the bootstrap command. You do not need to open a new Visual Studio Code window.

1. Review the project structure. It should look something like this:

    - `src/`: React + TypeScript frontend
    - `rayfin/`: Rayfin backend configuration (`rayfin.yml`, data entities)
    - `data/`: Seed data and **the original prompt + dataset used to generate this template** (worth a look if you're curious how it was built)
    - `package.json`: Dependencies and scripts for the project, including `build` and `dev`.

1. In the terminal, run this command to open the new generated project:

    ```shell
    code field-services-app
    ```

1. You can now close the previous VS Code window, as we won't be using it anymore. In the new VS Code window that you opened with the project, open the terminal.

1. Run this command to initialize a new Git repository:

    ```shell
    git init
    ```

1. Next, add all the files to the staging area with this command:

    ```shell
    git add .
    ```

1. Configure your Git identity so Git can create the commit:

    ```shell
    git config --global user.email '@lab.CloudPortalCredential(User1).Username'
    git config --global user.name '@lab.CloudPortalCredential(User1).Username'
    ```

1. Finally, make your first commit with this command:

    ```shell
    git commit -m "Initial commit - bootstrap from template"
    ```
